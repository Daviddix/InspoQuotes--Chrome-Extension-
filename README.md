## IMPORTANCE NOTICE
Due to the fact that i wasn't able to register my chrome extension, you won't be able to download it from the chrome extension store ðŸ˜ž

BUTTT, you can download the extension folder and use the extension locally on your system by importing the files to chrome and activationg the extension from there. 

Here's how to do that: 
1. Open chrome 

2. Click on the Extensions menu puzzle button and select Manage Extensions at the bottom of the menu.

3. Enable Developer Mode by clicking the toggle switch next to Developer mode.

4. Click the Load unpacked button and select the extension directory.
